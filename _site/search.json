        "content": "Analytics Project, Gasal 2024 - Part 2Instructor: Mansur M. Arief, Ph.D.This graduate course digs into the application of analytics to projects based on (semi)realistic datasets, guided by theories and algorithmic principles. In Part 2 of the course, students will focus on prescriptive analytics approaches (including linear and nonlinear programming one-shot decisions as well as sequential decisions), with a particular emphasis on optimization and decision-making algorithms. Building on the foundations laid in Part 1 (descriptive and predictive analytics), the course continues to prioritize hands-on group projects. This approach creates a sandbox learning environment where students can collaboratively apply their skills in ideation, modeling, and communication to solve complex, real-world challenges.Course objectivesUpon the completion of the course, the students are able to  identify real life problems that require analytics  choose the appropriate methods or tools applicable to a certain problem  apply tool and methods to address certain problem  showcase the skills in presenting to results and explain the insights obtained from the projectsLectures  The lectures are on Fridays, 6:30-8:10pm WIB in Zoom (link posted in MyITS classroom).  Attendance is required (by SIMT and ITS).  Active participation is highly encouraged.Office hoursOffice hours (optional) are Saturday, 8am-9am WIB. During this time, feel free to use the “Office Hours” Zoom link to chat with me. If you want to meet with me outside of these hours, use this calendar.TextbooksNO required textbook for this course. I will provide reading materials in MyITS classrooms from chapters of the book we are currently preparing for this course. It is useful to consult materials from the following sources:  Algorithms for Optimization (M. J. Kochenderfer and T. A. Wheeler) textbook (chapters available for free),  Algorithms for Decision Making (Mykel J. Kochenderfer, Tim A. Wheeler, and Kyle H. Wray) available for free.A great additional resource is the Engineering Design Optimization (Joaquim Martins and Andrew Ning) also available for free.Other Resources  Jupyter Notebook Examples  Prescriptive Analytics Project (Book Draft)  Project Webpage Template  Project GalleryGrading and assignmentsHere is the grade breakdown for this course            Assignment      Weight      Cumulative                  Reflections (1 and 2)      10%      10%              Proposal presentation      10%      20%              Peer review      10%      30%              Midterm report      15%      45%              Final report      25%      70%              Final presentation      30%      100%              Project repo/website      5%      (extra point)      Please submit your assignments either by filling the form online or by uploading them in your MyITS.
