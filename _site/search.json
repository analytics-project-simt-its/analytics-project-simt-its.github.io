        "content": "Analytics Project, Gasal 2024 - Part 2Instructor: Mansur M. Arief, Ph.D.This graduate course digs into the application of analytics to projects based on (semi)realistic datasets, guided by theories and algorithmic principles. In Part 2 of the course, students will focus on prescriptive analytics approaches (including linear and nonlinear programming one-shot decisions as well as sequential decisions), with a particular emphasis on optimization and decision-making algorithms. Building on the foundations laid in Part 1 (descriptive and predictive analytics), the course continues to prioritize hands-on group projects. This approach creates a sandbox learning environment where students can collaboratively apply their skills in ideation, modeling, and communication to solve complex, real-world challenges.Course objectivesUpon the completion of the course, the students are able to  identify real life problems that require analytics  choose the appropriate methods or tools applicable to a certain problem  apply tool and methods to address certain problem  showcase the skills in presenting to results and explain the insights obtained from the projectsLectures  The lectures are on Fridays, 6:30-8:10pm WIB in Zoom (link posted in MyITS classroom).  Attendance is required (by SIMT and ITS).  Active participation is highly encouraged.Office hoursOffice hours (optional) are Saturday, 8am-9am WIB. During this time, feel free to use the “Office Hours” Zoom link to chat with me. If you want to meet with me outside of these hours, use this calendar.TextbooksNO required textbook for this course.

        "content": "# What is Reflections for?I have been asked this question a *lot* of times. So, I decided to write this page to answer it. ## TL;DR*Reflections are part of your learning process. It is not for grading or assessment purposes, but rather for you to reflect on your learning journey.*## Why Reflections MatterDuring my time at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), I had the privilege of taking a Deploying Machine Learning Models course with [Chris McComb](https://cmccomb.com/) during the Covid pandemic. This experience profoundly shaped my understanding of why reflections matter in technical courses. In the midst of remote learning, our reflection exercises became an anchor that helped us stay grounded and process our learning journey.Through regular reflections, we were able to:- Identify which concepts truly resonated with our professional goals- Recognize gaps in our understanding that needed more attention- Connect theoretical concepts with practical applications in our own contexts- Build a personal knowledge repository that we could reference laterOne particularly valuable aspect was how reflections helped us distinguish between what was immediately applicable to our work and what might become relevant later. Rather than treating every topic with equal weight, we learned to be intentional about where to focus our energy based on our individual contexts and goals. Little did I know that such a simple exercise would have such a profound impact on my learning journey and was based on rigorous scientific research. See for instance [Davis et. al. (2013)](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003448570-4/reflection-metacognition-engineering-practice-denny-davis-michael-trevisan-paul-leiffer-jay-mccormack-steven-beyerlein-javed-khan-patricia-brackin).The practice of reflection also created space for us to acknowledge when certain concepts didn't align with our current needs - and that's okay. This honest self-assessment helped us make more informed decisions about our learning priorities and professional development paths. In short, reflections are a tool for you to assess what you are learning, why it matters (or doesn't), and how you might apply these insights in your own context.## Final ThoughtsDrawing from this experience, I've incorporated reflections into this course not as a bureaucratic requirement, but as a tool for deeper learning and professional growth. When you write your reflections, think of them as conversations with your future self and to decide what you want to learn next. If by any chance you found that you do not need anything from this course, feel free to drop it and focus on your other priorities.",

        "content": "# Who is This Course For?## TL;DR*Well, first of all, the answer will be different for different times.*At the time of writing this page, this course is designed for you if you are interested in hands-on experience in making data-driven decisions as a course project. This course is designed to help you learn how to structure your project, how to build an optimization model, how to prepare data, and how to use the model to make an informed decision and present it to your audience.By no means, this course is designed for you if you are looking for a course that will teach you the theory of data analytics or theory of operations research. This course is not for you if you are looking for a course that will teach you how to use data analytics tools such as Python, R, or Julia from scratch. Although, you will learn how to use these tools in this course. The focus of this course is to help you learn how to apply prescriptive analytics to solve problems in your own context.## Lessons Learned from Past SemestersThat being said, my own reflection throughout this course is that many students are not familiar with the tools and techniques that we will be using in this course early on. While the notion of \"analytics\" is not new to them, the notion of \"prescriptive analytics\" is. Most of wrong project directions are due to the lack of familiarity with the scope of the prescriptive analytics. To be clear, we will not be focusing on making predictions for new data, nor making insightul visualizations for high-dimensional features, especially in the second half of the course. We will be focusing on making decisions based on data, which might use some of these techniques. We will most often be using tools such as AutoML to automate the process of building a model and handwave the process of data preparation and model training (see for instance [optimization with a surrogate objective in the Model Examples resource](/resources/#4-model-examples) section).What I have come to realize is that we will need to revisit how to read the \"summation\" operator in the context of compact formula representation and how to write them. This is often the first thing that students struggle with when they are trying to read chapters from the book and write math expressions in Pyomo or similar modeling tools. This is absolutely fine, and we will have a few short assignments to help you get familiar with this.## What You Need to Succeed in This CourseA **lot** of practice. Again, this is a course that is designed for you to learn by doing. You will be required to do a lot of practice on your own, and you will be required to do a lot of practice in class. You will be required to do a lot of practice in the project.The good news is that you will be working in a team, and you will have a lot of support from your peers. You will also have a lot of support from me and my team, as the instructor.## You Decide Which Aspect You Want to Focus OnAs of 2025, I will be working on setting up different tracks for this course, depending on your interest. The tracks will be as follows:- **Track 1:** The track that is designed for those who are interested in hands-on coding and modeling experience. This track will be focused on helping you learn how to use Python, Pyomo, and other tools to build models and solve them given a data and an objective. You will be evaluated based on your ability to build a useful model, solve it, and verify the solution. You will be required to build a model that can be prototyped rapidly (for instance using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) or [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)).  - **Track 2:** The track is for you if you want more data processing and visualization experience. You will be provided with a model and solver and your job is to find and process real-world data from your organization and visualize the results that your supervisor can comprehend and use to make decisions. Tools such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) will be highly useful. You might need to extract results from Pyomo models to feed into these tools. You will be evaluated based on your ability to collect, present, and process data as well as visualize and validate the results.  - **Track 3:** This track is for those who are interested in the supervisory and project management side. You will be required to work with your team and ensure their well-being and progress. You will also be required to strategize how to deal with risks and uncertainties in the project. Tools such as [GitHub project management](https://github.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), and Google Suite ([Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), [Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/), [Slides](https://slides.google.com/), [Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/)) might be useful. You will be evaluated based on the delivery of your project (presentation, report, and code), the reviews from your team members (peer review), and the insights you provide as a supervisor (managerial insights and team review).You will be required to choose one of the tracks above. If you are not sure which track to choose, you can choose the track that you are most interested in and adjust before the midterm. The tracks you choose will define the way you will be evaluated in this course.",
